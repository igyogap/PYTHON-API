# API Python

I developed this API to facilitate secure user authentication through Login and Register functionalities. The security of the API is enhanced by the implementation of JWT (JSON Web Token) for robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/igyogap/PYTHON-API.git
    ```

2. Change into the project directory.

    ```bash
    cd your-project
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment.

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment.

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        .\env\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On Linux:

        ```bash
        source env/bin/activate
        ```

5. Install dependencies.

    ```bash
    pip install -r req.txt
    ```

## Usage

Running the application is as simple as executing python app.py in the terminal from your project folder.
```bash
python app.py
```
