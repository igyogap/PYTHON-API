# API Python

I developed this API to facilitate secure user authentication through Login and Register functionalities. The security of the API is enhanced by the implementation of JWT (JSON Web Token) for robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Installation

Create Virtual enviroment.
```bash
python -m venv env
```
Use the enviroment
```bash
# on windows
. ./env/Script/activate

# on Linux
. ./env/bin/activate
```
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install dependancies.

```bash
pip install -r req.txt
```
